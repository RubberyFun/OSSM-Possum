# OSSM Possum 

#### This is a bluetooth remote app for the stock firmware of the [Kinky Makers OSSM](https://www.researchanddesire.com/pages/ossm) that runs as native iOS or Android app, as a web page, or as an offline PWA.

## Setup

### There are a few options for using this app:

1. Just pull up this web page in Chrome: [https://rubberyfun.github.io/OSSM-Possum/public/](https://rubberyfun.github.io/OSSM-Possum/public/) 

1. Download it for offline use as a PWA:  Pull up the above webpage, open the browser menu (usually a three dots icon) and choose "Add to Home screen" then "Install".  Poof, its on your phone even if you're in a dungeon with no cell service.

1. Get it from the Google Play store.  This is WIP - estimated public launch will be 2/14/2026 due to Google red tape. If you want to test you can find me on [the Kinky Makers discord](https://discord.com/channels/559409652425687041/1286888639501959280/threads/1469058487123443888) and I'll add you to the testing group. Then you can [get the test version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubberyfun.ossmpossum.app) (but the link is dead unless you give me your email)

1. [Get it from the Apple App Store from this link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ossm-possum/id6758223317) or by searching for "ossm".  Apple is more straightforward to work with: they just want money. (it's $100/yr to launch apps and you can't do it without having a newer mac).

1. Install the APK directly on your Android device.  You can easily look up how to do this, I won't go into it here.  The APK file is [in the releases](https://github.com/RubberyFun/OSSM-Possum/releases/tag/1.3).

## Quirks

- This only supports OSSM devices with a stock firmware from 2026 or newer. If you bought your OSSM before that you can easily upgrade it using their [web flashing tool](https://dashboard.researchanddesire.com/app/tools/web-flasher).

- I didn't include simple penetration mode.  It starts up in the "Simple Stroke" pattern already...They are identical so I just don't see the need.

- If you use a browser and not the app: Safari and Firefox are not onboard with web pages having access to bluetooth...and they never will be for better or worse.  You need Chrome for the web version on Mac or PC...oh and Apple has a stranglehold on iOS chrome, so it won't work for iPhones/iPads at all besides the app.

## Planned features

- Control multiple OSSM's linked from one panel
- Control multiple OSSM's separately from individual tabs
- Automation tab?  Set it to ramp up the speed or stroke over a time span. Maybe have patterns.  
- I'm hesitant to allow input/integration from sources like XToys...I think that's out of scope for the little Possum and gets into [EOM territory](https://github.com/RubberyFun/endless-orgasm-machine).
- [DM me your suggestions at the Kinky Makers discord](https://discord.com/channels/559409652425687041/1286888639501959280/threads/1469058487123443888)

## Fine print

I made this for people to enjoy...no strings attached, no cost, no in-app advertising.  [The code is open-source, posted on Github](https://github.com/RubberyFun/OSSM-Possum).
