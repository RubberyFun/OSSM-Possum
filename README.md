# OSSM Possum

#### This is a bluetooth remote app for the stock firmware of the [Kinky Makers OSSM](https://www.researchanddesire.com/pages/ossm).

## Setup

### There are a few options for using this app:

1. Get it from the Google Play store.  This is WIP - estimated public launch will be 2/14/2026 due to Google red tape. You can get the test version at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubberyfun.ossmpossum.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubberyfun.ossmpossum.app)


1. Just pull up this web page in Chrome: [https://rubberyfun.github.io/OSSM-Possum/public/](https://rubberyfun.github.io/OSSM-Possum/public/)

1. Download it for offline use as a PWA:  Pull up the above webpage, open the browser menu and choose "Add to Home screen" then "Install".  Poof, its on your phone even if you're in a dungeon with no cell service.


1. Get it from the Apple App Store...  Apple is more straightforward to work with: they just want money. (it's $100/yr to launch apps and you can't do it without having a newer mac).  Estimated release date is 2/6/2026.

## Quirks

- This only supports OSSM devices with a stock firmware from 2026 or newer. If you bought your OSSM before that you can easily upgrade it using their [web flashing tool](https://dashboard.researchanddesire.com/app/tools/web-flasher).


- I didn't include simple penetration mode.  It starts up in the "Simple Stroke" pattern already...They are identical so I just don't see the need.

- If you use a browser and not the app: Safari and Firefox are not onboard with web pages having access to bluetooth...and they never will be for better or worse.  You need Chrome for the web version...oh and Apple has a stranglehold on iOS chrome, so it won't work for iOS at all without an app (but chrome on Mac does).

## Fine print

I made this for people to enjoy...no strings attached, no cost, no in-app advertising, completely open-source.
